# theListWeb
web version of 'the list' idea to practice front end and back end.

To make use of database/firebase features you need to add a local file in the src/ directory. The file contents should contain the keys needed to access the firebase project when testing or running locally. Future development will not need this step as deployemnt should be automated and available. For now, the file contents can be provided by the creator of this project :)
